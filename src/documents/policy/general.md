My commissioned work is generally pretty complex, and each person's
request is unique.

Note on terminology: the _artist_ is the person being commissioned. Even though we don't sell art. Maybe software is art?

## Overview
The process generally looks like this:

1.  The requester fills out a form on the website outlining some of the details
    of what they want.
    -   This should cover the majority of cases; for the rest, you can probably just skip
        to step 2.
    -   The end of the form will prompt the requester to cryptographically commit to the
        contents of the applicable policy documents, as well as their form answers. This
        is meant to protect both parties by "signing off" on the contents; however, this
        is _not a legal signature_, and serves only for recordkeeping in case something
        goes wrong.
2.  The requester messages the artist with the details.
3.  _(this is where a queue would go, if there is one)_
4.  We talk about the details and agree to payment.
5.  Early draft (see below for details)
6.  Discussion
7.  Development to completion
8.  Revisions, maybe

## 1. Forms

All the instructions are on the forms themselves.

The goal of the forms is to get information that might not seem obviously important
_before_ having a big discussion, and to direct requests that might not be a great
fit for this service.

The form is hosted on a static website, so you can't actually submit it directly to
the website. Instead, at the end of the form, you'll be directed to a separate page
to enter your Discord username and user ID and given some text to paste into the
channel, as well as a file containing the committed content.
